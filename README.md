## üìñ Overview
This repository provides a **hands-on cybersecurity lab** designed to simulate and detect **unauthorized cryptocurrency mining (cryptojacking)** within Microsoft Defender XDR environments.  

Cryptojacking is a persistent threat tactic that hijacks computing resources for mining cryptocurrency, often leading to:  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High CPU/GPU utilization and reduced performance  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased electricity and infrastructure costs  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Security blind spots that attackers can exploit  

This lab helps SOC analysts, students, and defenders practice **threat hunting**, **KQL detection queries**, and **incident response workflows**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Simulate miner-like activity safely in a controlled lab.  
- Detect file, process, persistence, network, DNS, and performance indicators.  
- Correlate telemetry across multiple Defender XDR tables.  
- Apply a structured **Incident Response Playbook** to containment, eradication, and recovery.
