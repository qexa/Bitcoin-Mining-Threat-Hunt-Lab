## ðŸ”Ž Overview
A practical threat hunting lab built for **Microsoft Defender XDR** to simulate, detect, and respond to unauthorized cryptomining activity (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero).  

The lab provides **safe attacker simulations** and **ready-to-run detection content**, helping analysts sharpen their hunting skills against cryptojacking techniques such as high CPU usage, persistence, and suspicious mining pool traffic.  

---

## âš¡ Why This Lab?
Cryptojacking is a growing enterprise threat that silently consumes resources while degrading performance. This lab recreates real-world conditions where cryptomining may occur:

- Persistent **CPU/GPU spikes**  
- **User complaints** about sluggish performance  
- **Network beacons** to mining pools  
- **Suspicious persistence mechanisms**  

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:** Detect, investigate, and eradicate cryptomining with Defender XDR.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Simulation Mode** â†’ Safe PowerShell scripts to mimic miner-like behavior (process, file, network, CPU load).  
- **Realistic Mode** â†’ Optional loopback-only `xmrig` miner execution for advanced users (no external traffic).  
- **Detection Content** â†’ 8 KQL queries for processes, file events, network activity, persistence, and resource anomalies.  
- **Threat Intel Integration** â†’ Watchlist CSV of known mining pool domains.  
- **Response Toolkit** â†’ IR playbook + automated cleanup script.
